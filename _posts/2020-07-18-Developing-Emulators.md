## The Beginning

At first, I wanted to write a Nintendo Switch emulator to verify the results of my code learning. Just when I was â€œtemporarily" abandoned by my country during the coronavirus, I can spend some time to learn something interesting. (what a wonderful country!!)

This project is not an easy job, thus I plan to learn how to develop emulators step by step. However, I know nothing about the details of learning to develop an emulator and can only plan rough steps at the beginning.

I heard Chip-8 is the easiest emulation project due to the small number of opcodes (only 35 in total). So I plan to do this first, and then maybe I will try the NES emulator.
